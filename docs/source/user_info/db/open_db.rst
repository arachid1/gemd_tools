The OpenDB class is a tool available both in-script and via the command line, designed for interacting with a database to manage model artifacts efficiently. It offers various capabilities, including loading models, executing queries, and more. The tool is designed to streamline database operations for model management through a user-friendly interface accessible via the command line.

OpenDB offers a simple yet powerful interface for interacting with databases. It allows users to specify the database name, provide the path to a JSON file containing database credentials, and set the output directory for storing results. This flexibility makes it easy to integrate OpenDB into existing workflows and projects.

One of the key features of OpenDB is its ability to load models into the database. This functionality is crucial for managing model artifacts and ensuring they are easily accessible when needed. Additionally, OpenDB provides a range of queries (see **list_queries()**) that can be executed to retrieve data from the database, enabling users to perform complex analyses and extract valuable insights. Additionally, OpenDB syncs with Open Graph to easily plot data from the database, providing users with powerful visualization capabilities.

In future updates, OpenDB aims to support graph databases, enabling users to work with different types of databases seamlessly. It also plans to introduce support for natural language queries, making it easier for users to interact with the database using plain language. 

Overall, OpenDB is a versatile and efficient tool for interacting with databases. Its user-friendly interface and powerful capabilities make it an invaluable asset for anyone working with model artifacts and databases.
