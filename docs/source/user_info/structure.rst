OpenMSIModel is designed with a modular and structured approach to materials data management. This section provides an overview of the key components and their roles within the library.

Components Overview:
---------------------

- `Workflow.py`: This module contains knowledge about materials science workflows. It serves as a central hub for building and managing GEMD models. The `build()` function within Workflow encapsulates the process of model creation, and it can ingest and structure existing GEMD models.

- `Subworkflow.py`: Subworkflows are flexible structures that can be used for various purposes, such as structuring, discovery, and serialization of GEMD model elements. They are essential for facilitating data analysis and exploration.

- `ProcessBlock.py`: ProcessBlocks are a type of Subworkflow designed to coalesce GEMD elements in their natural structure. They represent materials, ingredients, processes, and new materials. ProcessBlocks simplify data retrieval and model building.

- `Element.py`: Element serves as an interface and wrapper for data modeling formats like GEMD. It abstracts the use of GEMD, encapsulating functionalities for controlling templates, specifications, and runs. Materials, processes, ingredients, and measurements extend Element to provide specialized functionality.

- `OpenGraph.py`: This module offers capabilities to build and visualize networkx or graphviz objects from GEMD objects. It interprets relationships between GEMD elements using their UUIDs and produces various output formats, such as SVG and GraphML.

- `OpenDB.py`: OpenDB is a tool that enables interaction with databases for managing model artifacts. It provides functions for loading models, executing queries, and other database-related tasks.

Understanding the relationships and functionalities of these components is crucial for effectively working with OpenMSIModel. Explore the documentation for each module to gain in-depth knowledge of their usage and capabilities.

Next, you can delve into specific modules and learn how to leverage them for your materials data management needs.
