OpenMSIModel is a powerful Python library that facilitates working with the GEMD (Graphical Expression of Material Data) format. It serves as a bridge between generalized laboratory, analysis, and computational materials data. OpenMSIModel allows you to structure complex scientific workflows into meaningful data structures, model them in graph and relational databases, explore them through interactive graphical interfaces, and build long-term, shareable assets stores.

Key Features:
-------------

- Efficiently structure and model scientific workflows.
- Interact with GEMD objects seamlessly.
- Facilitate discovery and analysis of materials data.
- Build interactive graphical representations of your data (OpenGraph).
- Store and manage models in relational or graph databases (OpenDb).

With OpenMSIModel, you gain the ability to organize, analyze, and share your materials data effectively. This documentation will guide you through the installation process and help you get started with using this powerful tool.
